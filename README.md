## Day 6/30 – Notes App

As part of my 30 Days JavaScript Challenge, I built a clean and responsive Notes App using Vanilla JavaScript that allows users to create, edit, and manage notes seamlessly with real-time persistence.

This project focuses on building dynamic UI components, handling user interactions, and maintaining application state using Local Storage.

## Tech Stack

HTML5
CSS3
Vanilla JavaScript

## Features

Create unlimited notes
Edit notes in real-time
Delete notes with smooth animations
Auto-save using Local Storage
Note title + timestamp support
Dark mode toggle with theme persistence
Responsive UI for mobile & desktop
Clean and minimal design

## What I Learned

Using Local Storage for persistent data
Dynamic DOM creation & event delegation
Managing multiple editable components
Implementing UI state handling (create, edit, delete)
Building reusable and scalable UI logic
Designing responsive layouts with CSS
Implementing theme switching with CSS variables

## Future Improvements

Note categories / tags
