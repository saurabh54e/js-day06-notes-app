## Day 6/30 – Notes App

Continuing my 30 Days JavaScript Challenge, I built a simple and clean Notes App using Vanilla JavaScript that allows users to create, edit, and manage notes easily.

## Tech Used

• HTML
• CSS
• Vanilla JavaScript

## Features

• Create unlimited notes
• Edit notes in real-time
• Delete notes easily
• Auto save using Local Storage
• Clean and minimal UI
